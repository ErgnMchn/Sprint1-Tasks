Jav is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),
meaning that compiled Replaced code can run on all platforms that support Replaced without the need to recompile.[18] 
Jav applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Replaced virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
The syntax of Replaced is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
The Replaced runtime is sentence make provides dynamic make capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not
available in traditional is sentence compiled languages. As of 2019, Replaced was one of the most popular programming languages in use
according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for is sentence clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
